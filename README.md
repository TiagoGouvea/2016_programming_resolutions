# Programming Resolutions for 2016

## Commit every day

After reading ["Write Code Every Day"](https://medium.com/@efexen/write-code-every-day-aab8c7c192f5#.il9ia02kd) from Ville Hellman (that was inspired by John Resig ["Write Code Every Day"](http://ejohn.org/blog/write-code-every-day/) I decided to write a list of things I want to learn in 2016 (not everything neither so little) and start the year commiting it.


## Programming

My plan here are focus more on technologies I already  know.
